        When I am not hitting the books, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends,
        as well as enjoying the natural beauty of Iowa's outdoors. Some of my favorite activities are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fishing for Bass and Trout</li>
        <li>Hunting for Whitetail Deer and Turkey</li>
        <li>Golfing</li>
        <li>Kayaking</li>
        <li>Going to baseball games</li>
    </ul>
